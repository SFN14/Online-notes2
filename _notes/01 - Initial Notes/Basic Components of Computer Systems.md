# Hardware
It is the physical or tangible parts of the computer.

## Classified as follow
### Input Devices
This allows the user to input data/facts into the computer in away that the computer can understand. 

### Processing and memory devices
This acts as the computer's brain. This is the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the computer. 

#### Parts of the Processing Device
Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) - This is the part that does the math and processes data.
Control Unit - this controls the processes in the computer and coordinates the other parts.

#### Types of memory devices
Random Access Memory (RAM) - This is the temporary storage device that the Processor immediately needs.
Secondary Storage Device - This where information is permanently stored after data has been processed

### Output Devices
This is where the computer communicates with the user and outputs what it processed. 

### Communication Devices
This is how computers communicate with another computer. This can be wired or wireless.


# Chipset as a hardware part
You can add a network card

## North Bridge
Controls the CPU, RAM, Graphics Card, and Ethernet 

## South Bridge
USB, IO devices, storage, FLoppy, COM, LTP, etc.

# Software
It is the collection of related programs that contain the step-by-step instructions telling the computer how to perform a task.

## Application Software
It refers to a program designed to help the user to perform a particular type of work. It is generally distinguished from system software because it deals more with data processing applied in business, education, science, and other tasks. 
Ex: 
Microsoft Office, Games, Chrome, etc.

## System Software
This software manages the computer hardware and works with the other software. It is computer software designated to operate the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software.

Ex:
### Operating systems
### Hardware Drivers

Ex: 
Computer programmers, computer engineers, software designers, system analysts, server administrators, computer technicians, network administrators, etc.
