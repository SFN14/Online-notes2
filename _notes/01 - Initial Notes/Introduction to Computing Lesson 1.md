# Data 
- Raw, Unprocessed facts, figures symbols or observations
- It can be any format, audio, numbers, visual, or bytes.
Characteristics
- Lack of context
- Various Formats
- Building blocks of information

It has to be structured and organized to be information. It is the pre-requisite of information. 

Examples: 
Numeric Data
- Temperature readings
- Stock Prices
- Population of a City

Textual Data
- Names
- Addresses
- Product Description

Date and Time Data:
- Date
- Time
- Date and Time

These data cannot be understood on its own due to lack of context so we don't know what they refer to.

# Information
- Processed and interpreted data with context and meaning.

Characteristics:
- Provides knowledge and insights
- Organized and understandable 
- Used for decision-making

This is what you called data that is contextualized, and organized. Now it has meaning and can be used for anything. 

Examples:
Data: "42.195"

Information: "The distance of a marathon race is 42.195 kilometers."

# Data to Information

Temperature reading 32.5 C

Information: The current temperature reading is 32.5 degrees Celsius. This information can be useful for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, or daily planning. 

Stock Price: $150.25

Information: The stock price for the given security is $150.25. This information is essential for investors and financial analysts to track the value of the stock in the market.

Population of a City: 1,000,000

Information: The population of the city is 1,000,000. This data point provides a demographic insight into the size of the city's inhabitants and is valuable for urban planning and resource allocation. 

Name: John Smith

Information: The name "John Smith" represents an individual's personal identity. it could be useful for identification, communication, or record-keeping purposes. 

Address: "123 Main Street, Anytown USA"

Information: The address "123 Main Street, Anytown USA" describes a specific location, This information can be used for postal delivery, navigation, or contact purposes. 


# Importance
Data is essential for information creation.
Information aids decision-making and understanding.
Both are crucial in various fields (Business, science, technology).

This is important because raw data or bytes of a computer does not make any sense without context. So when we give them context we are able to use it.

In IT, we are able to use the data given or provided by a client so that it can be used in their software, or website.

IT find ways to convert data into useful information that can be used and applied. 


# Information Communication Technology (ICT)
Definition:
It involves using technology for collecting, processing, and sharing information. 

It uses tools like the internet to communicate quickly with each other. Turning physical things into digital things that can be easily sent across a fast highway that stretches all across the world.

# What is a computer
It is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to programmed instructions. It can store, retrieve, and manipulate information making it a versatile tool for various applications.

Types of Computers:
1. Analog Computers
	Computers that works with continuous data and use physical Phenomena like electrical voltages or mechanical movements. Excel on tasks that require real-time measurements and simulations.
	Ex:
	Weighing scales
	Speedometer
	Flight Simulators
	Voltmeters
	
2. Digital Computers
	Uses bytes or 1s and 0s to communicate and to be interface to. This is the most common type of computer that we can see and interact today. Like phones and desktops and Laptops.
	
3. Hybrid Computers
	Combine aspects of both analog and digital computers. They use analog components for specific functions, such as data acquisition or control, while employing digital processing for more complex calculations. They are often used in scientific and industrial applications.
	They often switch the type of computers they use depending on what they need to do.
	Ex:
	Electrocardiogram Machine in Hospitals
	Gasoline Stations pumps
