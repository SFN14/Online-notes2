## What is a Program Flowchart?
- A program flowchart is a diagram illustrating the logical steps involved in a software program or programming task. 
- One of the First things a programmer will do is create a flowchart.
- They start with a simple process map and quickly add more complex stuff.
- Program flowcharts can be handy for explaining the order of events in a program.
- They can also illustrate a computer program's data, processes or decision flows.
- This can help you to understand the flow or process of a field that you don't know so that you can make the program that you were assigned to that field. 
- This is meant so that a non-programmer cannot understand programming language can understand what you are making. 
## Benefits of Programming Flowcharts:
- When It comes to understanding programming or a logical structure, programming flowcharts are the best way of working. 
- When a designer is creating a program, there can be certain loopholes that can hinder the progress. To avoid that, they can design the app or website with programming flowcharts before working on them. 
- The engineer working on the debugging process can look at the programming flowchart, making it easier to debut the program.
- For reviewing a program, the program, the designer may need to look at the programming flowchart.
- They can analyze the program with  the help of the logical diagram of the flowchart and then modify it as per their requirement. 
- The engineers can also use flowcharts as a way of documenting their program correctly.
- As the programming flowcharts working as blueprints, it is time-efficient while creating a new program or application.

# What is Logic Formulation?

The Process of coming out with the basic steps to implement  procedure in computer programming.
This is usually resorted to when having top-down design.
Flowcharts and pseudo codes are the two of most common output.

Bringing the steps as required by the task in proper order so that when it is executed procedurally the desired result is achieved according to the required output specification. 

Everyone will have a somewhat different way to solve a problem.

## Basic Control Structures
Logical constructs that specify how instructions in a program are to be executed. The framework of the program.
1. Sequence - keyword: order
2. Selection - Keyword: option
3. Repetition - keyword: loop

### Sequence
Keyword: Order
Instructions are designed to be executed in the order the are written. You cannot skip parts of the code.
This provides the basis for other Basic Control Structures.

### Selection 
Keyword: Branch, Conditional, Decision, or Option
It uses the diamond symbol for the decision. 
How the program reacts depending on what happens or is input put the user.
A programmer should anticipate all the things that the user can do. 
#### 3 Types
1. Single Selection
2. Double Selection
3. Multiple Selection

### Repetition
Keyword: Looping or Iteration
The lines of code or processes repeat until the program says that its done.
This can also be iterations, or counting to know when to stop. 
If you have something that loops infinitely, remember that you there should be a stop, because an infinite loop is tedious on the user's part.

### How to solve a problem
Break the big problem into smaller problems that you can solve.

When laying out the logic, use simple words. 

Consider the step by step of how the computer will process the information.

There are clients that tells a story of what they want, while others set what they need.
