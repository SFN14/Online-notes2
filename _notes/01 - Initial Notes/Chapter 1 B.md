## What is a Program Flowchart?
- A program flowchart is a diagram illustrating the logical steps involved in a software program or programming task. 
- One of the First things a programmer will do is create a flowchart.
- They start with a simple process map and quickly add more complex stuff.
- Program flowcharts can be handy for explaining the order of events in a program.
- They can also illustrate a computer program's data, processes or decision flows.
- This can help you to understand the flow or process of a field that you don't know so that you can make the program that you were assigned to that field. 
- This is meant so that a non-programmer cannot understand programming language can understand what you are making. 
## Benefits of Programming Flowcharts:
- When It comes to understanding programming or a logical structure, programming flowcharts are the best way of working. 
- When a designer is creating a program, there can be certain loopholes that can hinder the progress. To avoid that, they can design the app or website with programming flowcharts before working on them. 
- The engineer working on the debugging process can look at the programming flowchart, making it easier to debut the program.
- For reviewing a program, the program, the designer may need to look at the programming flowchart.
- They can analyze the program with  the help of the logical diagram of the flowchart and then modify it as per their requirement. 
- The engineers can also use flowcharts as a way of documenting their program correctly.
- As the programming flowcharts working as blueprints, it is time-efficient while creating a new program or application.
