# Summary 
Random Access Memory or RAM is a temporary [[Storage]] of important information, it is much faster compared to [[Solid State Drives]] but not as fast as [[Cache]].

# What is RAM? 
Random Access Memory or RAM is a temporary [[Storage]] of information like [[Cache]] but much slower. There are many types of RAM but the most used one today is [[Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory]] or [[Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory|DDR SRAM]] or [[Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory|DDR]] for Short. The reason why it called [[Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory|Double Data Rate]] is because, for every clock cycle of the [[Processor]] the data from the RAM can be sent twice.

# Two Types of RAM
There are different types of ram depending on the usage:
DIMM - This type of ram is the usual long sticks that you find in Desktop computers. 
SODIMM - This type of ram is what you usually find in laptops and compared to DIMM, they are much shorter.
These two type of RAM are essentially the same and just have a different form factor.

# RAM compatibility
RAM Sticks are usually notched at the contacts or teeth to prevent the user from mixing different [[Generation of Ram]], because different generation of RAMs are incompatible with each other. There are some cases where a [[Processor]] can use two different generations of RAM, but it can only use one generation at a time. Due to RAM's volatile nature, when power is cut, data is almost immediately lost, however this is circumvented by [[ECC RAM]]. 

# How RAM affects other Components
In multitasking workloads, RAM has one of the biggest impact to performance, this is due all the data that the [[Processor]] needs to be ready immediately has to be in RAM. If there isn't enough capacity of RAM of the system, some of the information will go to the [[Storage]] of the system temporarily, which can impact greatly the performance of the system. However the amount of RAM isn't the only thing that affects the performance of the system. In the case of [[AMD Ryzen]] processors, [[RAM Performance]] like RAM speed, matters a lot due to how the [[Microarchitecture]] of the [[Processor Platform]] works. But [[Intel Core]] processors are heavily affected by [[RAM Performance]], but still does benefit from it.
