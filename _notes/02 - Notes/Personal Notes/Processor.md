# Summary 
A processor is the part of the computer that thinks, and computes. It uses [[Bits]], as information and uses [[logic gates]] to calculate the information to solve it. The major parts of a processor the consumer looks at are the [[Processor Core]] and [[Cache]] of the processor.

# What is a processor? 
A processor is the part of the computer that thinks. It has an input of data called [[Bits]] and goes through a process to solve the problem we've given it. It is made of silicone or a [[Semi-conductor]] that selectively turns off or on gates that permit or block electrical signals to satisfy conditions. The processor usually socketed to the [[Motherboard]].

# How does a processor think?
A processor thinks and solves a problem by receiving [[Bits]] or a group of 1 and 0s. 1s represent on, while 0s represent off. They are then interpreted by the processor going through basically electrical 'wires' that get closed off or open depending on the initial [[Bits]] that were presented to the computer. 

## How the thinking happens
When a bit of 1 goes through a 'wire' of a processor it will act as a powered, or on signal, while the bit of 0 that goes through another 'wire' of the processor, will act as a unpowered signal, or off. A combination of [[Multiple bits]] going through multiple wires of the processor interacts with each other and make [[logic gates]], these gates are the ones that makes a processor actually process information and does math to the [[Bits]] and solves it. 

# The parts of a processor
As a consumer the parts that you have to notice when buying a processor are:
1. [[Processor Core]] - These are the part of the processor that does the computing and thinking.
2. [[Cache]] - This the temporary storage of information for the processor, it acts like [[RAM]] but since it is part of the processor, this is much faster. It usually has 3 levels, L1 is the fastest, while L3 is the slowest.
There are more parts of a processor but the normal user doesn't have to know nor understand them in their purchasing decisions, because those parts don't usually affect [[Processor Performance]].

## The most common type of [[Processor Architecture]]:
[[Arm Processors]] - These processors are most commonly seen in mobile devices, like phones and recently, laptops.
[[x86 Processors]] - These are processors mostly seen in desktops and high powered laptops.
