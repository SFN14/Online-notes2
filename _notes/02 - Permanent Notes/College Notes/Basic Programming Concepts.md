# Summary 




# What is computer programming? 
It is the process of writing instructions that are executed by computers, this can be written though an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Pen and paper. These instructions called 'code' is written in a programming language then translated by a computer into assembly language, then is translated again to be understood by the computer. 

## Machine Language 
It is the way that [[What is Computer Language#Computer Language|computers talk]], by using [[What is Computer Language#Representing the decimal system using Binary.|binary digits]] (1s and 0s), it is the natural language of a computer, thus they are machine dependent. 
Due to this, computers aren't really smarter than humans, because we humans can take different information and understand it and make something out of the information. While a computer can only use 1s and 0s to talk, though yes they can use it in complex ways, be in the end of the day they can only understand 1s and 0s. 
Examples:
10111000 - 184
00000101 - 5
00000000 - 0

## Assembly Language
It uses mnemonics or symbols to represent instructions and data. They use assemblers to convert the 'code' to machine language. This is known as a low-level programming language, however, the lowest level is machine language. 
[[Arrays#Compiling process|Examples]]:
MOV AX, D6
MOV BX, 02
ADD AX, BX

## High-level Languages
These languages uses English-like statements and it uses compliers or interpreters or translate the source code to machine language. 

# Programming Basics
## Debugging
It is the process of eliminating mistake in your program.

### 3 Types of errors
#### Syntax Error 
Grammatical mistake in your program. 
Ex: Missing comma or a quotation mark, or misspelling a word. 
#### Run-time Error
Detected when the program is run.
Ex: Attempts to perform operations (Such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values).
#### Logic Error
This occurs when you don't get the desired outcome in your program. This occurs because the programmer did something wrong with the logic of the program.
Ex: Getting a division of two numbers as an output but the expected is multiplication of numbers. 

# History of Java
## In 1991 James Gosling and his team began designing the first version of Java.
-> its first name was Oak.
- Variable should be declared prior to storage of any values, these are known as data types.
- integeramed this because there was an oak tree outside of their HQ.
-> The main goal of Java back then was to be used for home appliances
-> Java Byte Code or Byte Code.
  
## 1994: Ideal for Web browse, then was produced by Patrick  Naughton and Jonathan Payne.
-> Evolved into the browser known as Hot Java
-> Start of Oak's Connection to the internet.
## 1995: Netscape Inc. released its browser capable of running Java Programs
-> 1st Public implementation was Java 1.0
-> Oak's name was changed to Java due to a company previously having a trade mark on the name.
## Java became popular with the advent of Java 2
-> Has multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.

# What is program variable?
- It represents a location or a set of locations in the computer's main memory.
  -> Values are placed in these locations known as variables. 
- Different values are placed in the storage depends on the type of value stored.
  -> The values may be changed from time
	-> 10, -23 ,100
	Ex: Int, Float, Bool, Char, String, etc.s
- When declaring variables, in Java rules must be followed accordingly. 
## Values that can be placed in variables
1. Character Values
   - Standard ASCII Characters
	-> A, B, b, x, Y
   - Special Characters
	-> &, !, %
2. Numeric Values
- Real
	-> 3,  8, 50
