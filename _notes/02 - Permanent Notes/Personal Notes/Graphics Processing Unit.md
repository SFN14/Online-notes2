# Summary 


# What is a GPU? 
The GPU is the [[Graphics Card]]'s processor, it is the part of the [[Graphics Card]] that does the computing of information and turns it into frames. The difference of a GPU and a [[Processor]] is that GPUs are more specialized and focus solely of computing graphics or workloads that require needs a lot of calculations. Compared to a [[Processor]] that is more versatile and can do many different calculations and workloads that the GPU would struggle. 

# How does a GPU work? 
The GPU works essentially the same as a [[Processor]] but its parts have different purposes. Instead of having few multipurpose cores, a GPU as [[Graphics cores|much more cores]] that reaches into the thousands that is specialized. These [[Graphics cores|cores]] focus on calculating visual information or polygons to be rendered in screens.

# GPUs aren't always found in Graphics Cards
Since a GPU is essentially a specialized [[Processor]] it doesn't always need to be in a Graphics Card. Because there are cases where the [[Processor]] and GPU can share resources and have a smaller foot print. In Desktops these are usually called an [[Accelerated Processing Unit]], or [[Accelerated Processing Unit|APU]], simply a [[Processor]] with a GPU. Combining the [[Processor]] and GPU are usually done in smaller devices, or in [[Arm Processors]] or where deeply integrated systems are better, like consoles. This is because combining the [[Processor]] and GPU can be beneficial, where the [[Processor]] can send information to the GPU quickly, however this is usually at the cost of the performance of the GPU due to the size constraints. 

# Can a Computer Run without a GPU?
No, a computer cannot run without a GPU, this is because there is no way to output information. Even low end computers have a GPU to output information. When people say "there is no Graphics Card in the system" it only means that the Graphics Card it self is missing. But depending on the computer, it could already have a low power GPU that could display an image, like most of [[Intel Core]] series of processors that doesn't have the 'f' in the name.
