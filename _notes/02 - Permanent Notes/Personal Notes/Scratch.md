Programing is just inputs, processes or algorithms and outputs.

Main code:

Simplicity is better for programming.
Less code = less room for errors = less possible bugs

Abstraction is the process of turning lines of codes or blocks of code into one code that does the same thing. This helps with readability of a program. This is most commonly known as functions. 

First you have to give a function a variable so that you can tell it what to do. Without it, you cannot add input to a function, nor can it 'function' properly. 

To solve big problems, first you have to break it down to what you need it to do and basically make pseudo code so that you can understand what you need to so. Make a checklist of the things that you need to do then work from there. Then work bit by bit, part by part of that checklist, until you complete the whole project.

The computer runs so fast the the question of "Is the mouse pointer touching?" was already answered, which is no.

Here we keep asking the program the questions until the condition is met nothing happens. But, when we point the mouse pointer, since its always asking the question, we can finally satisfy the yes of the question and do the command in the if statement.

Note: remember to use re-usable code if you can, to save on resources and to make the code simple and clear.
