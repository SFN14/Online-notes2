Programing is just inputs, processes or algorithms and outputs.

Main code:

Simplicity is better for programming.
Less code = less room for errors = less possible bugs

Abstraction is the process of turning lines of codes or blocks of code into one code that does the same thing. This helps with readability of a program. This is most commonly known as functions. 

First you have to give a function a variable so that you can tell it what to do. Without it, you cannot add input to a function, nor can it 'function' properly. 

To solve big problems, first you have to break it down to what you need it to do and basically make pseudo code so that you can understand what you need to so. Make a checklist of the things that you need to do then work from there.
