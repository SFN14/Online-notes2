# What is a Case? 
Well the name is self explanatory, a Case is a part of a computer that encloses the parts of the computer to keep it safe and prevent a massive build up of dust. It is usually made of Plastic, Metal, Acrylic, or Glass. It has an intake where air goes in and an exhaust where the hot air is expelled from the system, though to move the air, the [[Case Fans]] are the ones that work. Without the case, air won't be properly directed and cooling would suffer. There are ports in the front of a case that you can plug things into to be used by the pc. These ports include, [[Universal Serial Bus]]es, or headphones and microphone jacks.
