# Summary 
The Motherboard is where all the computer components connect and communicated with each other.

# What is a Motherboard? 
The motherboard is where the [[Processor]], [[Graphics Card]], [[RAM]], [[Storage]], [[PSU]], [[PCIE Expansion Card]]s, [[Input Device]], and [[Output Device]] connect and communicate with each other. It is made from a [[Printed Circuit Board|PCB]] and has traces connecting the parts of the motherboard to each other. 

# Major Parts of the Motherboard

[[PCIE slot]] - This slot is where you plug in the [[Graphics Card]] and [[PCIE Expansion Card]]s.
[[RAM slot]] - This slot is where you slot in the [[RAM]] of the system. This usually has 2 or 4 slots, while in the [[Server]] or prosumer hardware has more than 4 slots, it usually has 6 - 8 slots or more. 
[[Processor Socket]] - This socket is where you place the [[Processor]], of the computer. There are two kind of sockets that are used, [[Land Grid Array]] or [[Land Grid Array|LGA]], and [[Pin Grid Array]] or [[Pin Grid Array|PGA]]. This socket is how the [[Processor]] communicate with the motherboard.
[[Voltage Regulator Module]] or [[Voltage Regulator Module|VRM]] - This is part of the motherboard that delivers power to the [[Processor]]. 
[[CMOS Battery]] - This is a [[Batteries|battery]] that powers the [[Basic  Input Output System|BIOS]] of the motherboard. 
[[Chipset]] - This chip controls major functions of the motherboard and the part that communicated with all the parts connected to the motherboard. 
[[I/O Ports]] - This is where external peripherals connect to the motherboard. This is where you would find the [[Input Device]]s and [[Output Device]]s.
[[M.2]] slot - This is a type of [[PCIE slot]], where [[Storage]] can be placed. It's speed can either be [[Serial Advanced Technology Attachment|SATA]] or [[Non-Volatile Memory Express|NVME]].
[[Serial Advanced Technology Attachment|SATA Port]] - This is a storage interface that is usually for bigger drives.
