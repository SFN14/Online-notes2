# Initial Notes
I first place my notes into Initial notes, where I basically dump the idea of a topic. This is where I start a note, then when I want to expound on it, or connect it to another idea I would start to start to expound on it and eventually when I'm finished, I transfer it to Permanent Notes.

# Permanent Notes
My permanent notes are where I connect ideas and expound upon them. It is separated into three folders, College Notes, Personal Notes, and Literature Notes.

1. College Notes - are where I place the Notes I make in College.
2. Literature Notes - are the notes that I make when reading Book, Articles, or Researches.
3. Personal Notes - these are notes that I make when placing knowledge that I have, or thinking of concepts that I can connect to other Personal Notes, Literature Notes, or College Notes.

# Sorting (In Progress)
To sort all the information I have I first sort it by status:
#💡 - Means that it is a Initial note.
#📝 - Means that it is being written.
#📄 - Means that it is done being written.
#📕 - Means that it is a work in progress Map of Content (MOC).
#📘 - Means that it is a finished Map of Content.
#📚 - Means that it is a collection of MOCs.
#📚📚 - Means that it is the Master MOC.
There are also other tags that goes to the 'Tags' sections, which will also act as filters so I can find what I need. I also use the 'Tag' sections to connect the note to another note.

# Map of Content
A Map of Content is where all the main ideas of a topic connect to, it can be called Table of Content of a Topic.

The main MOC of the system will show which MOCs I am currently working on. You May go to which MOC you would want. The ones that I haven't worked on will be on the not actively working on. 

# Navigation
To easily navigate the Vault, I recommend to use the nodes on the bottom of the page, along with the MOC so that you can easily find what you want.
