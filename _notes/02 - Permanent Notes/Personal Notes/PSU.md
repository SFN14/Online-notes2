# Summary 
A PSU is the heart of a computer, it is  the component that delivers power to all the components of the computer.

# What is a PSU? 
A Power Supply Unit, or PSU is a component of the PC that delivers power to the [[Motherboard]] and [[Graphics Card]]. It is a Dc - Dc converter, it does this so that the components will have clean power and not get damaged. How much power a PSU can provide is rated in Watts. However, not all PSUs can provide 100% the rated Wattage due to losses in electricity, so it always goes over the rated Wattage. Due to this, there something called an [[80 + Certification]], this certification says how efficient the power supply is at supplying power. The higher the Certification, the nearer it is at supplying its rated Wattage and wastes less electricity.
