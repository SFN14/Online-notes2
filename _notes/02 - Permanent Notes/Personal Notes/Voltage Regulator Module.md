# What is a VRM?
A Voltage Regulator Module or VRM, is a component of a [[Motherboard]] that delivers the needed power by the [[Processor]]. The [[Motherboard]] gets the power from the [[PSU]], then the VRM distributes the power to the [[Processor Core]]s to which one the needs it the most. This concept is also used in [[Graphics Card]]s, where the VRM would distribute the available power given by the [[PSU]] to the components of the [[Graphics Card]], like the [[Graphics Processing Unit]], [[VRAM]], fans, and even RGB lights.
