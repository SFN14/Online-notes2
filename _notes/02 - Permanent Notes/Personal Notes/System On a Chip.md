# What is a System on a Chip?
A System on a Chip or an SOC, is a [[Computers]] that has a [[Processor]], [[Graphics Processing Unit]], [[RAM]], and [[Storage]] integrated into one chip, or integrated circuit, hence the name System on a Chip. This type of [[Computers]] usually is used in low powered applications, or in [[Arm Processors]] architecture, because these [[Computers]] are usually used in phones, tablets or other devices that need to have low power consumption. Due to all the components being near each other these computers are very efficient for their size and performance. The downside of this approach is that, no components can be replaced due to the tight integration of each component.
