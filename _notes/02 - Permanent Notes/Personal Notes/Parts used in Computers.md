# Summary 
There are 9 main components of a computer, these are the: [[Processor]], [[Motherboard]], [[RAM]], [[Graphics Card]], [[Storage]], [[PSU]], [[Case]], [[Input Device]], [[Output Device]].

# What are the parts that you usually find in a computer? 
[[Computers]] are computing devices that have 9 Main components, these components are:
	1. [[Processor]]
	2. [[Motherboard]]
	3. [[RAM]]
	4. [[Graphics Card]]
	5. [[Storage]]
	6. [[PSU]]
	7. [[Case]]
	8. [[Input Device]]
	9. [[Output Device]]

# What are the parts that aren't normally mentioned in computers?
These parts are usually found in most Desktop Computers and Laptops. There are also some crucial parts, but not always mentioned:
1. [[PCIe Expansion Card]]
2. [[Cooler]]
3. [[Batteries]]
4. [[Case Fans]]
   The combination of these components could come in different forms, there are the conventional ways like Desktop and Laptop, where you can clearly see the parts and where they are. While there are devices like [[System On a Chip]] or [[System On a Chip|SOC]]s that makes it hard to distinguish which part is which due to its tight integration. Examples of these are devices with [[Arm Processors]].
Example:

## Conventional Computer

*Fig 1 Desktop Internals*

In this image we could see all the internal parts of a computer, minus the [[Input Device|input]] and [[Output Device|output devices]]. They are easily identifiable and easily labelable.

## Arm based computer

*Fig 2.3 Apple M1 Motherboard*


In these images, you can see that most of the parts of the computer in the [[System On a Chip|SOC]], the [[RAM]], [[Processor]], and [[Graphics Processing Unit|GPU]] is all in one place, while the [[Storage]] is near the [[System On a Chip|SOC]]. The [[PSU]] in this case is spread all over the [[Motherboard]] to control the charging and power distribution of the computer. Without the pre-written labels, the individual parts are much harder to identify.
