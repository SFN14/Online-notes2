# Summary 
A Graphics Card is a part of the computer computes information into images or frames that can be outputted to a monitor.

# What is a Graphics Card? 
The Graphics Card is that part of the computer that does the graphics computing and also outputting a signal to the monitor. The purpose of a Graphics Card is to display the information given to it by the [[Processor]], calculating where the pixels go, how to render the images etc., and display the image to an [[Output Device]] usually a screen. 

# What is the usage of graphics cards? 
Graphics Cards are primarily used to render graphics for games or workloads that needs a lot of calculations. This is due to the Graphics card's [[Graphics Processing Unit]] having many [[Graphics cores]] that has to do many calculations due to the workload of displaying graphics. Workloads benefit with the usage of GPUs include: 
1. Video Editing
2. 3D Graphics Rendering
3. Machine Learning
4. Blockchains and Cryptocurrency Mining
There are also software that can leverage the GPU to have better performance, like Photoshop, and web browsers. 

# What are the Parts of a Graphics Card?
 The Graphics card is basically a small computer inside your computer, due to it having its own, [[Voltage Regulator Module|VRM]], a special type of [[RAM]] called [[VRAM]], and its own [[Processor]] called a [[Graphics Processing Unit]] or [[Graphics Processing Unit|GPU]]. However, the parts that you focus on to know [[Graphics Card Performance]] is the [[Graphics Processing Unit|GPU]] and the amount of [[VRAM]].
