# Summary 
A thread is a task given by an application. It usually refers how many task one [[Processor Core]] can do.

# What are Threads?
A Thread is a process opened by an application, it tells the [[Processor]] on what it needs to run and compute information of that specific application. Modern [[Processor Core]]s usually can each handle two threads given by an application. To understand more clearly, think of a thread as a task given by an application, and a [[Processor Core]] being the one who's doing the task. The amount of threads a [[Processor Core]] has is how many pairs of hands it has to do the task, which is usually two.
