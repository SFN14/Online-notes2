# What is AMD Ryzen?
AMD Ryzen is a series of [[x86 Processors]] made by [[AMD Incorporated]], mainly targeted towards, desktop and workstations. This series of processors are usually had a [[Pin Grid Array|PGA Socket]] but as switch to [[Land Grid Array|LGA Sockets]]. It uses the [[Zen Microarchitecture]], released in 2017, and has be innovated upon since. Innovations such as, the "chiplet design" for [[Processor]]s, the infinity fabric, and the stacking of  the [[cache]] on top of the [[Processor die]].

# What are the models of Processors of Ryzen?
## Ryzen 9
This model of [[Processor]]s are the highest tier that [[AMD Incorporated|AMD]] offers, it has 12 [[Processor Core|cores]] and 24 [[threads]] or 16 [[Processor Core|cores]] and 32 [[threads]]. Usually, this is the highest performing [[Processor]]s in single-threaded and multi-threaded workloads that [[AMD Incorporated|AMD]] offers in the consumer desktop market. 

## Ryzen 7
This model of [[Processor]]s are the second highest tier that [[AMD Incorporated|AMD]] offers, usually 8 has [[Processor Core|cores]] and 16 [[threads]]. These [[Processor]]s are usually targeted towards creators and streamers due to the amount of threads it has and single-threaded performance.

## Ryzen 5
This model of [[Processor]]s are the targeted towards the mid-range market. This model of [[Processor]]s usually has 6 [[Processor Core|cores]] and 12 [[threads]] or 6 [[Processor Core|cores]] and 6 [[threads]], and in some older generation [[Processor]]s, 4 [[Processor Core|cores]] and 8 [[threads]].

## Ryzen 3
This model of [[Processor]]s are the targeted towards the budget market. This model of [[Processor]]s usually has 4 [[Processor Core|cores]] and 8 [[threads]]. However, since the 5000 series of processors, [[AMD Incorporated|AMD]] has not added a newer Ryzen 3 model.

# What is the naming scheme have to know in Ryzen? 

## From Ryzen 1xxx - Ryzen 5xxx
ex: Ryzen 7 3700x
"Ryzen 7" denotes the model of processor.
"3xxx" denotes the generation of processors. However, sometimes this isn't always the case.
"x7xx" denotes if the product is the higher or lower performance version. 
ex: Ryzen 7 3800x vs Ryzen 3700x, the Ryzen 7 3800x will have slightly better performance compared to the Ryzen 7 3700x.
"xx00" denotes the model no. to differentiate products.
"x" denotes the power suffix.
### Suffixes
x - Higher Performance
"no suffix" - Standard Desktop
G - Has integrated [[Graphics Processing Unit|GPU]] or an [[Accelerated Processing Unit|APU]]
T - Low Power Desktop
S - Low Power Desktop with [[Graphics Processing Unit|GPU]]
H - High Performance Mobile
U - Standard Mobile 
M - Low Power Mobile

## Ryzen 7xxx and onwards
ex: Ryzen 5 7640U
"7xxx" Denotes the year the processor is released. 7 is 2023, 8 is 2024, 9 is 2025... you get the idea.
"x6xx" Denotes which processor it is.

| Number | Processor |
| --- | --- |
| x1xx | Athlon Silver |
| x2xx | Athlon Gold |
| x3xx| Ryzen 3 |
| x4xx| Ryzen 3 |
| x5xx| Ryzen 5 |
| x6xx| Ryzen 5 |
| x7xx| Ryzen 7 |
| x8xx| Ryzen 7 |
| x9xx| Ryzen 9 |

"xx4x" Denote on which architecture the [[Processor]] is made.

|Number|Architecture|
|---|---|
|xx1x|Zen 1 or Zen +|
|xx2x|Zen 2|
|xx3x|Zen 3|
|xx4x|Zen 4|
|xx5x|Zen 5|
|you|get the idea|

"xxx0" Denotes if on which model the processor is. '0' means that it is the lower model, while the '5' means that it is the faster model. This is usually used to differentiate same processor models of the same architecture. 

"U"  Denotes the the suffix, the case now is that it indicated the TDP or the amount of heat the [[Processor]] will give. 

|Suffix| TDP |meaning|
|---|---| --- |
|HX |55W+| Max Performance |
|HS|~32W| Thin Gaming/Creator|
|U|15-28W| Premium Ultrathin|
|C|15-28W| Chromebook|
|e|9W| Fanless variant of the U|

(its a mess)
