# Summary 
In this part of the course you get to know what Computer Science is about, what your thinking should be and what is computer language. 

# What is Computer Science?
Computer Science, in its most basic definition is the art of problem solving. You are solving problems by harnessing the power of your own intuition and computers. 

"What ultimately matters in CS50 is not so much where you end up relative to your classmate but where you end up relative to yourself when you began."

The main purpose of this course is to turn something cryptic like this:

## What actual code actually looks like
```
# include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	printd("Hello, world\n");
}
```

```C++
# include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout>> "Hello world" >> ln;
}
```
into something that isn't cryptic, boiling it down to something simple, logic.

"All problems are just putting your problems into input then getting the output" What happens inside the box is what happens in the mind, or in the code.

However, for us to communicate with computers we must first know their language: [[What is Computer Language|A computer only speaks in binary, or the language of 0s and 1s.]]
