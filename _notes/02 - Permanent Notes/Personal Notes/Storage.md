# Summary 
Storage is a place to permanently store information that the computer will use later on.

# What is storage? 
A computer doesn't normally have a way to permanently store information, [[Cache]] and [[RAM]] are just temporary place to store information. That's what storage is for computers, a permanent place to store information, to recall it for future use.

## What are the most common types of storage?
[[Hard Disk Drives|HDDs]] or [[Hard Disk Drives]] - These are mechanical storage devices that use a spinning disk or platter that has a head that physically moves to [[Read]] and [[Write]] information from the spinning disk. These devices usually have a large storage capacity.

[[Solid State Drives|SSDs]] or [[Solid State Drives]] - These are electronic storage devices that uses [[Flash Memory]] to store information, these are much faster compared to [[Hard Disk Drives|HDDs]] due to the process of storing data being electronic.

## Types of storage interface
There are multiple ways of connecting storage to a [[Computers|computer]] notably:
[[Serial Advanced Technology Attachment |SATA]] or [[Serial Advanced Technology Attachment]] - This connection is the most common one among all the storage interface. This consists of a data connector and a power connector, the data goes to the [[Motherboard]] of the computer, and the power comes from the [[PSU]]. The storage devices connected to this interface are usually big. The standard with for devices that use this interface is 2.5 inches or 3.5 inches. (*However, there are drives that have a [[M.2]] form factor, or more known as a stick like a ram, these storage devices are [[Solid State Drives|SSDs]] that are the same as the boxed shaped ones but only differ in form factor and it is directly connected to the motherboard. Where the teeth of the device will have 3, 2 short and 1 long*)

[[Non-Volatile Memory Express|NVME]] or [[Non-Volatile Memory Express]] - This storage interface is a relatively new standard compared to [[Serial Advanced Technology Attachment|SATA]] but is much faster due it directly connected to the [[PCIE lanes]] of a the [[Processor]]. This interface is meant to be used with [[Solid State Drives|SSDs]] due to their performance. The form factor of drives are usually [[M.2]] but the teeth of the device will usually only be 2, one short and one long one. They could also come in larger [[PCIE Expansion Card]] that connects to a [[PCIE slot]] of the motherboard. 

[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] or [[Universal Serial Bus]] - This storage is interface is the most accessible among all the storage interface, it is also the slowest storage interface. This port is usually found on the sides of laptops, behind the [[Motherboard]], or on the front ports of a [[Case]].
