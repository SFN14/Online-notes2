# Summary 
Batteries are used to make computers portable.

# What are the use of Batteries in a Computer?
Batteries are usually used to make a computer portable, like in laptops. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used to store charge for laptops to use. Batteries are also used in Uninterruptible Power Supplies or UPS, to ensure that the PC can power down safely and lot loose data. In [[Motherboard]]s, batteries are used so that the [[Basic Input Output System|BIOS]] will remember their configuration and function properly. These are heavily used in phones for the obvious reason of making them be used anywhere.

# What are Batteries Made of?
Batteries are made of an one anode (anion '-'), one cathode (cation '+'), and an acid in between them. The cathodes are usually made of Cobalt Oxide (*Co<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>*), Manganese Oxide (*Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>*), or Nickle Oxide (*Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>*). While the anode part is usually made or graphite. 

# Dangers of Batteries
Batteries, when punctured, damaged, or leaks, it can cause fires, or corrosion. Which can cause environmental or property damage when left unchecked. However, when a battery is set on fire, it does not happen spontaneously and usually burns slowly and generally give you enough time to react to the fire. On the other hand, Lithium fires are hard to put out and releases toxic fumes while being on fire. Lithium fires can be put out by placing the Lithium battery in a bucket of sand, it usually extinguishes it quickly that way.
